### Cat vs Dog Recognition

**Objective:** Train a CNN to classify images of cats and dogs with high accuracy, even on unseen data.

Highlights:

* Used data augmentation (rotation, flip, zoom) to boost generalization.
* Implemented strategies to handle imbalanced classes.
* Tuned learning rate, batch size, and architecture for better accuracy.

  ### Emotion Recognition

**Objective:** Detect emotions from facial images for applications in human-computer interaction and social robotics.

Highlights:

* MaxPooling layers for feature extraction.
* Dropout to reduce overfitting.
* Standardized image sizes to improve model robustness.
* Achieved high accuracy across multiple emotion categories.


### SignMNIST â€“ ASL Letter Recognition

**Objective:** Recognize American Sign Language letters from images of hand gestures.

Highlights:

* Trained CNN on Sign Language MNIST dataset (excluding J & Z).
* Potential use cases in assistive technology for deaf/mute communication.
* Showcased strong feature extraction from low-resolution grayscale images.
