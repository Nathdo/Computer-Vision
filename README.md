# Computer-Vision

This repository contains various Computer Vision projects, including my work on Emotion Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). These projects explore image preprocessing, feature extraction with MaxPooling, and techniques like Dropout to handle overfitting. Each project highlights practical solutions to challenges such as handling different image sizes and improving model performance.
